Here's the protection of this file

![Checksec](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/cd927a4a-3692-4514-81f4-9c184fb79698)


Here's the function that we can input.

![intro_func](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/6a7433a3-462b-4abf-a0f2-ae935020c8a5)


In this challenge, the `win function` is `getSword()`.

![Win_func](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/14ea1790-72e8-40cb-86e2-d7736c0f0835)


The input function uses the `scanf` with `%s` format string, which we can easy use buffer overflow attack because `scanf` reads until it receives the null byte.

![format_s](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/53e2c5e7-82ba-4eee-aafb-88d97818e314)


So here's the stack I draw for this challenge.

![stack](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/bf3b9979-c2dd-4845-ace7-9447c8ee0ceb)


Now we just need the address of the `win` function to get the flag

![win_addr](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/310b4c17-a3a7-4a5b-ae02-836dfec10d7d)


![flag](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/91dea3af-4d03-4864-8044-efb8fe58895f)

In this challenge, it doesn't give me the binary file to exploit in local. Therefore I have to exploit directly in the remote server. The simplest technique I think to solve this challenge is format string vulnerability, so I try to test the input to see if it really works with the format string attack.

![Test_formatstr](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/8cfbcbf2-07a5-4b2d-9eb9-2eda34bbd422)


Yeah :) It really has format string vulnerability. Now, the format of the flag is `KCTF{flag}`, which in ASCII will be:
```
  4b:    K
  43:    C
  54:    T
  46:    F
```

So, I will find the position of output to see if there're hex values of this. Remember for the little endian.

Great!!! It's in the 6th position of output. Copy and paste to the Hex to String Converter online, this is the flag. So I just write the script to convert to these hex values into little endian and get the flag.

The excutable file only has NX flag, which we can't execute the shell in the stack. In the `main()`, we see there's a vulnerability due to the `get()`, which can occur buffer overflow attack.

![main_func](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/a95c8a43-dd14-49a4-84a0-bd7c0d3168fc)


The `win` function will give the shell for us. Now we need to make the program point to it.

![win_func](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/fca89470-a0c3-4f8a-9ac0-0bb41adc1ede)


We can use buffer overflow attack to redirect to the win function. First we need to know the address of the `win`.

![win_addr](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/51fde572-1b7b-4fbc-87c4-a4eaec3138e9)


Finally, draw the stack and get the flag.
