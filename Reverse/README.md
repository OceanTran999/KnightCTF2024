In this challenge, I don't see any calculation or modifying the passcode, so I think it may be just input the correct passcode. I find the value which converts in little endian will be `letMeIn`. When I try to input it really the passcode :) .

In this challenge, the `win` function will be `func1()`, which it checks if the pass key we input is correct, it will give us the flag.

Before calling the `func1()`, it will call the `func2()` first, and handle the passkey with `func4()` and `func3()`. So we just need to know how the `func3()` and `func4()` handle the pass key, we will get the flag.

![Func2](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/cc5c83c8-3ce3-4ac0-b48b-f85a231264ef)

![Func4](https://github.com/OceanTran999/KnightCTF2024/assets/100577019/9ed27fc1-c26d-43f1-b6db-9f2600148124)


In `func3()` and `func4(), it handles each characters in the pass key, if the character is in `A-Z`, it will computes different the `a-z`. Knowing this, we just write the script and printing the final pass key to get the flag.
